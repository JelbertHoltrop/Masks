# Masks
At this moment face masks against the corona virus are in short supply. 
This project is to design an effective mask that can be made by anyone.

Basis for the virus protection filter can be: https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39956
This must be converted to a process that can be done by anyone in a normal kitchen.
Basically it is a filter drenced in a kitchen salt/water solution and then dried.

Next we need a simple solution to make a face mask. What kind of cloth and shape is best?

Is there a way to test these masks? A mask that is not working could be more hazzardous than
no mask at all if it gives false protection.

After that anyone should be able to make these.
